# CSS Snippets

Just a few blocks of CSS that I've gathered from past projects and some really cool websites around the web.

Feel free to use them on your project, and to add some through pull request.

The best way to add CSS snippets is to create a folder and upload CSS and HTML files with comment blocks explaining what they should do.
